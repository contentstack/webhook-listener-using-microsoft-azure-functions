# Webhook listener Using Microsoft Azure Functions

Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the centre. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.

An automated webhook listener simplifies the process of managing content in Contentstack. When you make any changes to the fields of an entry, another field (that you specify) gets updated automatically. We have created an automated system that does exactly this.

# Tutorial
